          I began by brainstorming and refining the app's unique features to provide
          users with a quick, easy way to choose dining options. I then created detailed
          wireframes and mockups to establish a cohesive design and layout that guides
          the user experience. In designing the UI/UX, I focused on building an intuitive,
          engaging interface. For the frontend, I used React Native to create a responsive
          and seamless user experience. I also developed the backend, implementing RESTful APIs
          to manage data flow and securely access restaurant listings. As the full-stack developer,
          I was responsible for ensuring all components—frontend and backend—integrated smoothly.
          Throughout the process, I conducted extensive testing and prototyping, including unit,
          integration, and end-to-end testing, to ensure the app&apos;s reliability and quality at every stage.`,

       upon revisiting my original site, I realized that it 
       missed the mark in terms of usability and aesthetics. Over time,
        I learned that users often prefer familiar layouts, 
        as these make navigation easier and more intuitive. Going forward,
        I would draw inspiration from other successful portfolio sites,
